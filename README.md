<h3>Android Studio uses port 8081 by default</h3><br>
If Android Studio is using port 8081 (which is also the port used by React Nativeâ€™s Metro Bundler), you might run into issues. Here are a few ways to resolve this:<br>

1. **Stop any existing processes using port 8081**:<br>
    You can check which process is using port 8081 and stop it.<br>
    On Linux/macOS, run:<br>
    ```bash
    sudo lsof -i :8081
    sudo kill -9 <PID>
    ```<br>
    On Windows, run:<br>
    ```cmd
    netstat -aon | findstr :8081
    taskkill /PID <PID> /F
    ```<br>

2. **Change the Metro Bundler port**:<br>
   I didn't find a way to correcly change the port, when I tried to in android studio it just refused to.
